    "## Note about the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is an important part of programming.  Unfortuntely, it is pretty difficult to debug CUDA kernels directly in the Jupyter notebook for a variety of reasons, so this notebook will show terminal commands by executing Jupyter notebook cells using the shell.  These shell commands will appear in notebook cells with the command line prefixed by `!`. When applying the debug methods described in this notebook, you will likely run the commands in the terminal directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing\n",
    "\n",
    "A common debugging strategy is printing to the console.  Numba supports printing from CUDA kernels, with some restrictions.  Note that output printed from a CUDA kernel will not be captured by Jupyter, so you will need to debug with a script you can run from the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Back in the early days of CUDA, `nvcc` had an \"emulator\" mode that would execute CUDA code on the CPU for debugging.  That functionality was dropped in later CUDA releases after `cuda-gdb` was created.  There isn't a debugger for CUDA+Python, so Numba includes a \"CUDA simulator\" in Numba that runs your CUDA code with the Python interpreter on the host CPU.  This allows you to debug the logic of your code using Python modules and functions that would otherwise be not allowed by the compile.\n",
